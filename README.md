# Snake Game

A classic Snake game implemented in Python using the turtle module. The game starts with a slow-moving snake that grows longer as it eats food, speeding up with each meal. The player controls the snake with the W, A, S, D keys to move up, left, down, and right respectively. The objective is to eat the red food and avoid running into the walls or the snake's own body.

**Features**

•	Simple graphics using Python's turtle module.

•	Score tracking with a high score display.

•	Snake speeds up as it eats more food.

•	Real-time movement controls.

•	Dynamic game board boundaries and food placement

**Prerequisites**

To run the game, you need to have Python installed. The game requires the standard turtle, time, and random libraries, which are included with Python.

•	Python 3.x

**Objective**

•	Move the snake around the game area to collect the red food.

•	Every time the snake eats food, it grows longer and moves faster.

•	Avoid running into the walls or colliding with the snake's body, as this will reset the game.

•	W - Move Up

•	S - Move Down

•	A - Move Left

•	D - Move Right

**Code Structure**

•	head: Represents the snake's head, which the player controls.
